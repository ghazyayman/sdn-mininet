# This script uses the POX library to listen for incoming "PacketIn" events, which represent incoming packets on the network. When a packet is received, the script constructs an OpenFlow packet-in message and sends it back to the switch, effectively dropping the packet.

# This is just a basic example, you can add more rules and conditions to the script to filter traffic based on various criteria, such as IP address, port, or protocol. You can also use the script to implement more advanced features, such as stateful firewalling, intrusion detection and prevention, and traffic shaping.

# It's important to note that creating a firewall controller script requires a good understanding of programming, network protocols and security concepts. Also, you should consult the POX documentation for more information on how to use the POX API and write a firewall controller script.
